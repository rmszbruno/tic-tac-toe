# tic-tac-toe

I chose to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game to put my front-end skills into practice. This project served to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and also refresh my knowledge of structuring and styling using HTML and CSS, respectively.

After several iterations and tests, I managed to complete the Tic-Tac-Toe game project. It was amazing to see everything working as expected and to know that the front-end theories transformed into an interactive experience for the players.
